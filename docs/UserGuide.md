their students' contact details**. It is a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** based application, whereby you can type 
in various commands into an input box to perform certain actions. It also comes with a **Graphical User 
Interface (GUI)** to display information to you.

We believe that Pedagogue Pages will represent a huge upgrade for you when managing your 
students' contacts. Want to experience just how big of a difference it can make? Follow the steps **within this user

# Introduction to Pedagogue Pages
![Pedagogue Pages Logo](./images/Pedagogue%20Pages%20Logo.png)

Pedagogue Pages is an address book application for class rostering and student contact management that hold many 
advantages over traditional rostering methods such as Excel and physical methods. In terms of its basic functionalities as an address book, it performs just like any other similar application, allowing
for the creation, updating, reading and deletion (CRUD) of contacts.

However, we consider Pedagogue Pages to be **safer and more convenient than Excel** when it comes to these functions,
since it checks for empty fields when creating and updating new contacts, has no ambiguity within the commands given (One command, one action) and allows
for the adding and updating of multiple fields of a single contact at once.

Furthermore, Pedagogue Pages is **highly specialised** for the target audience, customized from the get-go for
**you** with the addition of fields such as `student ID` and `form class` for each contact. The
implementation of tagging and tag-related features such as **finding by tag** also allows for **unparalleled
flexibility** for student contact management not provided by Excel. Finally, even though we emphasise the benefits of 
using Pedagogue Pages over Excel, we provide full backwards compatibility with Excel with our import, export and migrate
features, which will allow you to seamlessly transition lists between Excel and Pedagogue Pages.

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.

2. If you are unsure if Java `11` or above is installed in your device, you can download Java `11` from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html). Take 
   note of the operating system of your computer (Linux, Windows or macOS) to download the correct file.

3. After ensuring that you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer, download the latest `pedagoguepages.jar` from the release **v1.3** [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/releases).

4. Copy the file to **an empty folder** you want to use as the **home folder** for Pedagogue Pages.

5. For users familiar with using the command terminal, open a command terminal, navigate using `cd` into the folder you 
   put `pedagoguepages.jar` in, and use the`java -jar pedagoguepages.jar` command to run the application. <br> If 
   you are uncomfortable with using the command terminal, **double-clicking** `pedagoguepages.jar` works too.

6. If all the steps above were performed correctly, an application window similar to the image below should appear in a 
   few seconds. For new users, the application window should contain some sample student contact entries. For users 
   that have previously used the application, it should be showing the list of student contacts you were viewing 
   before you exited Pedagogue Pages during the last session.

# Features

## Preliminary notes

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you. Parameters without `[ ]` around them are 
  compulsory fields that you must supply for the command to work. <br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also an acceptable input.

* **Parameters have input restrictions that can be found in this [table](#input-restrictions).**

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

## Basic features: Create, Read, Update, Delete

### Adding a student contact: `add`

**Purpose**: Adds a student contact to the student contact list in Pedagogue Pages. You can use it to add the details of new students.

**Format**: `add n/NAME p/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER_1, [PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER_2] e/STUDENT_EMAIL a/ADDRESS id/STUDENT_ID 
class/CLASS_NAME [t/TAG]…​`

**Example**: `add n/John Doe p/93333333, 92222222 e/johndoe@mail.com a/123 Oxford Street id/00001 class/3A t/Band` 
<br>
This sample command adds to the student contact list a student with the **name** `John Doe`, **student ID** `00001` 
from **class** `3A`, whose parents have the **contact numbers** `93333333` and `92222222` respectively. The student 
also has an **email** `johndoe@mail.com`, has the **address** `a/123 Oxford Street` and is from the school `Band`.  

**Image of command**: The image below shows the sample command within the command box <br> <br>
![Add command in command box](./images/AddCommandBox.png)
<br><br>
**Image of result**: The image below shows what the GUI of Pedagogue Pages should display after executing the sample 
command <br><br>
![Add command success](./images/AddCommandAftermath.png)
<br><br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: Additional information:**<br>
* Pedagogue Pages supports the addition of students with only `1` parent contact number. You can do so by only 
specifying `PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER_1`. <br> For example: `add n/John Doe p/93333333 e/johndoe@mail.com a/123 Oxford 
Street id/00001 class/3A t/Band` <br>
In such cases, the GUI of Pedagogue Pages will display 
`PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER_1` as the contact numbers of both `Parent 1` and `Parent 2`. So for the example above, both 
`Parent 1` and `Parent 2` of `John Doe` will have the contact number `93333333`.
* Pedagogue Pages use student id to identify each unique student. As a result, you cannot add a student with a duplicated
student id into Pedagogue Pages. 
</div>

### Displaying the entire student contact list: `list`

**Purpose**: Displays the entire student contact list for your viewing.

**Format**: `list`

**Example**: `list`

**Image of command**: The image below shows the sample command within the command box <br> <br>
![List command in command box](./images/ListCommandBox.png)
<br><br>
**Image of result**: The image below shows what the GUI of Pedagogue Pages should display after executing the sample
command <br><br>
![List command success](./images/ListCommandAftermath.png)
<br><br>

### Editing a student contact: `edit`

**Purpose**: Edits an existing student contact specified by his or her `student ID` in the student contact list.

**Format**: `edit STUDENT_ID [n/NAME] [p/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER, WHICH_TO_EDIT] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [id/STUDENT ID]
[class/CLASS] [t/TAG]…​`

**Example**: `edit 00001 p/94444444, 1 a/345 Cambridge Street class/3B` <br>
This sample command changes the following parameters of the student with `student ID 00001`: **first** parent phone 
number (specified by the parameter`WHICH_TO_EDIT`) to `94444444`, address to `345 Cambridge Street` and form class 
to `3B`.

**Image of command**: The image below shows the sample command within the command box <br> <br>

<br><br>
**Image of result**: The image below shows what the GUI of Pedagogue Pages should display after executing the sample
command <br><br>
![Edit command success](./images/EditCommandAftermath.png)
<br><br>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: Additional information:**<br>
* At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
* When editing tags, the adding of tags is not cumulative. <br> Example: If a student with `student ID 00001` has the 
  tags `Band` and `Tutoring Math`, and the command `edit 00001 t/Tutoring English` is executed, the tags `Band` and 
  `Tutoring Math` will be removed and the only tag the student will have after the command is `Tutoring English`.
* It is possible to remove all tags from a student by specifying no tag behind the prefix `t/`. <br> Example: `edit 
  00001 t/`.

</div>

### Deleting a student contact: `delete`

**Purpose**: Deletes a student contact specified by `student ID` from the student contact list you no longer wish to 
keep track of.

**Format**: `delete STUDENT_ID`

**Example**: `delete 00001` <br>
This sample command deletes the student contact with `student ID 00001`.

**Image of command**: The image below shows the sample command within the command box <br> <br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: Additional information:**<br>
* Use this command extremely carefully. The `undo` command _**cannot**_ reverse the `clear` command. 

</div>

### Deleting a tag from all students in the student contact list: `deleteTag`

**Purpose**: Deletes the specified tag from **ALL** students from Pedagogue Pages

**Format**: `deleteTag TAGNAME`

- Note that the first character of `TAGNAME` is automatically capitalized (if alphabetical)
- So `deleteTag tagname` would be functionally equivalent to `deleteTag Tagname`

**Example**: `deleteTag Band` <br>
This sample command deletes the Tag `Band` from all students in the student contact list.

**Image of student contact list before the command**: The image below shows the student contact list before the

**:grey_exclamation: Additional information:**<br>
* The cd command only accepts the `FILEPATH` end with `.json`. Example: `data/studentList.json` will be a valid `FILEPATH`.
* If there is no file under the provided `FILEPATH`, cd command will create one for you under the provided `FILEPATH`.

### Exporting a student contact list: `export`

**Purpose**: Exports the currently viewed student contact list as a CSV file to the `exports` folder, which you can 
then open with applications like Excel.

**Format**: `export FILENAME`

**Example**: `export Class 3C` <br>
This sample command exports the currently viewed student list as a CSV file named `Class 3C.csv`.

**Image of student contact list before the command**: The image below shows the student contact list before the
sample command was executed.

<br><br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: Additional information:**<br>
* To avoid overwriting of files, if the `FILENAME` you've provided already exists within the `exports` folder, 
  Pedagogue Pages will still export your current list, but with the name `export_{Date and Time}.csv`.

</div>

### Importing a student contact list: `import`

**Purpose**: Imports a student contact list stored in a CSV file within the `imports` folder into Pedagogue Pages, 
where you can run other commands on it.

**Format**: `import FILENAME`

**Example**: `import Class 3A` <br>
This sample command imports the student contact list within a file named `Class 3A.csv` into Pedagogue Pages. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: CSV format:**<br>
* For a successful import, the format of the student contact entries within the CSV file must strictly follow that 
  of the image below. Furthermore, all parameters must comply by constraints of Pedagogue Pages.
* There must be no duplicates in the `student ID` field within the CSV file. Else the import command will fail.

</div>

**Image of student contact list before the command**: The image below shows the student contact list in the CSV file 
before the sample command was executed.

![Import command success](./images/ImportCommandAftermath.png)
<br><br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: Additional information:**<br>
* After each successful import, a new JSON file containing the data from the imported CSV file is created in the 
  `data` folder. These `2` files will share the same name before the suffix.
* If the name of the CSV file you are about to import is the same as the name of a JSON file without the suffixes that 
  already exists in the `data` folder, the import will not be successful. Change the name of the CSV file before 
  attempting again.

</div>

### Merging student contact lists: `migrate`

**Purpose**: Merges the student contacts in a CSV file in the `imports` folder with your current student contact 
list open in Pedagogue Pages. 

**Format**: `migrate FILENAME`

**Example**: `migrate Class 3B` <br>
This sample command merges the student contact entries in a file named `Class 3B.csv` with the existing student 
contact list. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:grey_exclamation: CSV format:**<br>
* For a successful import, the format of the student contact entries within the CSV file must strictly follow that
  of the image below. Furthermore, all parameters must comply by constraints of Pedagogue Pages.
* There must be no duplicates in the `student ID` field, either internally within the CSV or in the resultant merged 
  student contact list, else the migrate command will fail.

</div>

**Image of student contact list before the command**: The image below shows the student contact list in the CSV file
before the sample command was executed.

## Troubleshooting and Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When opening a csv**, certain programs (like Excel, Google Spreadsheets) behave in such a manner that leading zeroes are removed. This might result in an invalid Student ID format to be imported.
As this is a 3rd-party program-specific feature, PedagoguePages does not control this functionality. Two possible solutions we suggest are:
   1. Using text-type apps like Notepad or Sublime to retain leading zeroes.
   2. Using **Format Cells** under Excel / Sheets to create a custom format to maintain the leading zeroes.
3. **When adding names to PedagoguePages**,
   1. Names containing `-` or `/`, e.g `Karl-Heinz` or `Mahesh s/o Alagu` would be considered invalid, and an understandable concern. However, we ask that until it is supported,
we recommend replacing the `-` or `/` with whitespaces or deleting them (whitespace would be more ideal to make full use of our find function).
   2. Numeric characters are allowed, and are chosen to be before Alphabetic characters lexicographically (so `John 1` would appear before `John A` if sorted by name). Names containing numbers are exceedingly uncommon, but we intentionally allow them,
      in favour of greater freedom. (and they are fully supported in PedagoguePages!)

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Pedagogue Pages home folder.
